I'm Computer Engineer at <a href="[text](https://www.azc.uam.mx/)">Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana</a>.  
The main reason why I decided to study this career is because I love video games and at some point I wanted to be a tester or a developer but over time and with what I have been learning I have become more interested in other areas.

  architecture: ["microservices", "event-driven", "design system pattern"],
  interested areas: ["Big Data", "Artificial intelligence","Databases", "Data mining", "Mobile development (more Android)", "IoT"],
  challenge: "I'm doing a master's degree in computer science."
}
